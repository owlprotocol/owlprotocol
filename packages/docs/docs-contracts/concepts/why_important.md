# Why It's Important

One of the most common use-cases of Owl Protocol's Dynamic NFT smart contracts is when a game wants to encode more data
about the asset onto the on-chain NFT itself.

This decreases the NFT's dependency on the game, *once the crucial data of the asset exists independent the game*, it can
start to evolve and allow others to create new utilities, decentralized mechanics, and features.

:::info
*The owner of the NFT **should always have full access to use their NFT in any way they choose**. Free from the dependencies of a centralized system.*
:::

### You may want to encode data and **state** such as the:

- Stats of the character of item
- A visual representation of a character or item
- Associate the NFT with **equipped items, enchantments, and special effects**
- Attach achievements, player statistics, and custom payload data

## Why It's Important

It's important to ensure that the critical data about the NFT, such as its visual representation, parameters, and state are on-chain because:

1. Marketplaces such as **Opensea, Blur, and Rarible** can render the full character with equipment, accessories, and cosmetics.

2. Other games, metaverses, and blockchain projects can integrate your NFTs, thus creating new mechanics, utilities, and **value for your NFTs**.

3. Gaming guilds, DAOs, and other ecosystems will give **special access, unlockable content, or benefits** to popular NFT communities and user bases.

## Initial Steps

Dynamic NFTs require a bit of planning ahead of time, although new traits can be easily added, it's much more difficult
to remove or modify traits.

However, adding more layers (options) to an **Image** trait is supported, as long as there is enough storage left,
this can be configured with the **`bitSize`** field. For more detailed information see: [IERC721Dna](/contracts/contract-guides/IERC721Dna).
