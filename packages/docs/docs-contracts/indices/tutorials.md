# Tutorials

Our tutorials will introduce you to Owl Protocol's Dynamic NFT features using basic use cases:

### 1. [Arbitrary NFT Data Encoding - ERC721Dna](/contracts/tutorials/nft-data)

This example shows how to encode any data into an NFT. We use a binary data format combined with an off-chain schema to maximize efficiency and
provide more data for 3rd-party tools to interpret your data.

Common use cases:
- **Membership NFTs** - Add crucial data you want to expose to partners on-chain in the NFT itself, allowing quick integration into DeFi, ticketing, and more.
- **Digital Twins** - Tokenize real-world assets for integrated on-chain tools to automate verification of ownership, and unlock DeFi use cases.

### 2. [Dynamic NFT Image with Removable Layers - ERC721TopDownDna](/contracts/tutorials/nft-image-layers)

This example introduces how to approach a new Dynamic NFT project and consider data encoding and how to deploy your project.

Common use cases:
- **Dynamic PFPs** - NFT art/profile pics with removable clothing, accessories, or any layers as standalone NFTs.
- **Web3 Gaming** - represent your avatar or character on-chain with all attachments, equipment, and/or inventory.
