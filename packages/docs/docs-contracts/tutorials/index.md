Our tutorials will take you through the basic use cases and are the best way to become acquainted with Owl Protocol's
Dynamic NFT features:

### 1. [**DNFT Arbitrary Data Encoding - ERC721Dna**](/contracts/tutorial-nftdata)

This example is shows how you can encode any data you need into the NFT. We use a binary data format combined with an off-chain schema to maximize efficiency and
provide more data for 3rd-party tools to interpret your data.

*Common Use Cases:*
- **Membership NFTs** - Add crucial data you want to expose to partners on-chain in the NFT itself, allowing quick integration into DeFi, ticketing, and more.
- **Digital Twins** - To tokenize real-world assets, having on-chain data about the real asset is important for integrated on-chain tools to automate verification
    of ownership, and unlock DeFi use cases.

### 2. [**Dynamic NFT Image with Removable Layers - ERC721TopDownDna**](/contracts/tutorial-topdowndna)

This example is an introduction in how to approach a new Dynamic NFT project with considerations for data encoding and deployment.

*Common Use Cases:*
- **Dynamic PFPs** - NFT art/profile pics with removable clothing, accessories, or any layers as standalone NFTs.
- **Web3 Gaming** - represent your avatar or character on-chain with all attachments, equipment, and/or inventory.
