## Owl Protocol is Developing **Standards** for NFT `Data` and `Logic`

### - **Dynamic NFT Data** - Standards for NFT Data Encoding

Owl Protocol is working with various groups to create templates and standards for specific industries or verticals.

- Our **Off-Chain Schema** architecture allows **one interface / set of smart contracts** to support multiple standards at once.
- A powerful JS SDK encapsulates all data management of our standards.

:::

### - **Dynamic NFT Logic** - Primitives for NFT Mechanics

Common Mechanics:

- **Combining** - (Crafting) Deploy external **Asset Router** smart contracts that can combine separate inputs and map to different outputs.

- **Attaching/Detaching** - (Equipment) An extension of the Top Down NFT concept to not only allow NFTs to own other NFTs, but also expose child NFT data recursively.

- **Breeding** - (DNA Inheritance) Advanced features on top of our **Asset Router** smart contracts that allow defining inheritance of traits/attributes.

## Uses

### Adding Data of Execution Value to NFTs

- Membership NFTs
- DAOs
- Loyalty Programs
- Cross Metaverse Interoperability
- Web3 Gaming

Our flexible JSON Schema allows developers andcreators to encode compressed binary data on-chain, that can decoded by anyone anyone with our SDK.

Add critical data such as **Date Last Transferred, Points, Level, Tier, Status, and more** in a manageable way.

Extend data standards for specific industries, ensuring that our NFTs can be understood and easily integrated with future/existing projects.

### Creating New Utilities for Existing NFTs

- **Partnerships/Collabs** - Adding New Crafting Recipes Across One or More NFT Collections

- **Token Gated Campaigns** - Allow Mint or Airdrop Campaigns with Complex and Engaging Rules

- **Revitalize Existing NFTs** - Add New Utilities to Existing NFTs by **Upgrading NFTs**

- **Repurpose NFTs from Dead Projects** - Create Combining Rules to Recycle Old NFTs into New Dynamic NFTs

### Tokenization of Real World Assets

Add critical data of the real world asset being represented in a standard data format.

Supports:

- **PDF Attachments** - Add an IPFS of pinned attachments such as Certificates of Authenticity, Proof of Reserves, and more.

- **Unique Identifiers** - Collaborate with existing working groups, or make your own standard for representing unique physical items on-chain in an understandable way.

- **Item Descriptors** - Define fields for capturing essential data for proper identification of the item.

- **Ownership** - Permissions to update, manage the location and owner or custodian of an item.
