# Owl Protocol Template Data

This package is for common / template data that is reused as:

- placeholder data for stories
- default example data for in-app tutorials

### Occasionally We Use This for Test Data

Although having a dependency on a single package for test data is discouraged, for now we are keeping this as is.

#### The Following Still Have Independent Test Data

Most of the data is still the same though, so it's somewhat redundant.

- contracts
- nft-sdk
